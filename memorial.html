            <p>
                <b>Guests with disabilities:</b> One of Jerry’s fraternity members has secured a golf cart to
                help transport guests from the garage to the memorial and back after it’s over. This is
                for people who will have difficulty negotiating the hill that is between the garage and
                Copley. If you need this kind of assistance, please contact Betsy at least one day before
                the 17 th in order to get the cell number for the golf cart driver.
                The meeting place for the golf cart is next to the ground level exit for the garage, across
                from the volleyball courts. There are two elevators to get out of the garage. Where you
                park will determine which elevator is closest.
            </p>

                <b>Directions from Canal Road:</b>
                You can drive into the back entrance of the university coming from either direction on
                Canal Road. There is a light. Follow the road. You will pass a guard house. I don’t know,
                if anyone will be in it. Don’t turn into the facilities garage which comes before the public
                parking entrance. Each level is color coded. Be sure to note where you left your car.
                Look for the nearest elevator.
