            <p>Gerald Anthony “Jerry” Schroeder passed away on December 11, 2023, in northern Virginia. He was born June 24, 1946, in 
                Indianapolis, IN, the only child of the late Ruth Lauck Schroeder and the late Anthony Schroeder. Raised in Indianapolis, 
                he graduated from St. Louis Seminary Preparatory High School (1964), Georgetown University (1969), and Indiana University 
                Law School (1972.) He also attended Mill Hill Seminary, Albany, NY (1964-1965.)</p>
            <p>In 1969, he was commissioned a 2LT in the U.S. Army and deferred military service until he graduated from Indiana University 
                Law School. He was promoted to CPT and trained at the U.S. Army Judge Advocate General School, University of Virginia, 
                Charlottesville, VA. He was assigned, and served for four years, as a Judge Advocate General plaintiff’s attorney in the 
                U.S. Army Physical Disability Agency at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, Washington, DC. His military decorations include 
                the National Defense Service Ribbon and the Meritorious Service Medal.</p>
            <p>Following military service, Mr. Schroeder had a distinguished thirty-three-year legal career in the U.S. Department of 
                Justice where he served in the Freedom of Information and Privacy Act Office (FOIPA), the Office of Intelligence Policy and 
                Review (OIPR), and finally as the Deputy Director of the Office of Security and Emergency Planning Staff (SEPS.) While 
                serving in OIPR, he was appointed as Acting Director by U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno.</p>     
            <p>During college, he pledged the Mu Alpha Chapter of the Alpha Phi Omega (APO – a national coed service fraternity) and served 
                as Georgetown’s chapter President and eventually was elected as the National President of the fraternity from 1990-1994.  
                Forever a loyal Hoosier, his passion was the “Indianapolis 500” which he attended almost every year for over fifty years 
                with twenty of his closest friends with whom he shared his enthusiasm. He ordered and distributed tickets and turned the 
                annual race into a fun-filled Memorial Day weekend. He was an Indy car racing fan and attended races around the country. 
                His other passion was baseball. In addition to attending many major league baseball games, he volunteered as an Umpire for 
                the McLean and Vienna Little Leagues and eventually trained others to be umpires. He followed all his children’s activities 
                and could be seen in the stands, along the sidelines and in the audience.</p>
            <p>He is survived by his loving wife of fifty-two years, Elizabeth Addy Schroeder, son Jeffrey Michael (Kayla Louise) Schroeder, 
                daughters Leslie Ann (Brendan) Riggs, and Kathryn Elizabeth Schroeder, grandsons Braedan Riggs and Cameron Schroeder, and 
                granddaughters Avery Riggs, Hannah Schroeder, and New Granddaughter Schroeder due in January.  He is also survived by many cousins 
                in Indiana and elsewhere. In addition to family, he leaves behind his life-long friends from Georgetown University and his 
                Fraternity members from the Mu Alpha Chapter of Alpha Phi Omega.</p>  
            <p>A celebration of his life will be held at a future date. He will be inurned in the Columbarium at Arlington National 
                Cemetery among his fellow servicemen who served their country.</p>
